CNM - A Multiplayer Rouge-Like Metroidvania
===========================================

History
-------
CNM has had many versions over the years, with the earliest ones being
different versions that all were played on 4-player split-screen (yes
with only 1 keyboard). Since then, another version of CNM was made:
CNM Online. CNM Online was a step forward, but looked just as bad and
had a lot of room for improvements, but they couldn't be made because
the code was too inflexible. So, this new version is going to be the
best and prettiest so far.
